# Model Browser Web Application Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Model Browser Web Application! This documentation provides an overview of the features and functionalities of our React-based web application. Our platform aims to provide users with a seamless experience in browsing, discovering, and exploring various models available on our platform.

## Features

### 1. Browsing Models

- **Description**: Users can browse through various models available on the platform.
- **Implementation**: Models are listed on a dedicated page. The layout and information displayed for each model are customizable.
- **Implementation Guidance**: We utilize a mock API, such as JSONPlaceholder, to fetch model data dynamically and enrich the browsing interface.

### 2. Favourite Models Wall

- **Description**: Favourite models, which receive more attention or have special significance, are showcased separately.
- **Implementation**: A dedicated wall displays these Favourite models, explaining why they are highlighted (e.g., high views, user favorites).
- **Implementation Guidance**: The determination of featured models can be done by users.

### 3. Model Details Page

- **Description**: Users can dive deeper into specific models to understand their functionality, usage, and provider information.
- **Implementation**: Each model has its own dedicated page providing detailed information, including description, provider details, code snippets, and potential use cases.
- **Implementation Guidance**: The page should offer a minimalistic design while providing essential details like model description, provider information, example code snippets, and use case scenarios.

## Implementation Details

- **Page Load Time**: The page load time of our application is 682ms. We measured this time using Performance API. Optimizing load time ensures a smooth user experience.

## Performance Optimizations

To decrease load time and increase performance, we implemented the following optimizations:

- **Context API (useContext)**: Efficient global state management to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve component performance.
 This was measured using the following JavaScript code snippet:

```javascript
const loadStartTime = window.performance.timing.navigationStart;
const loadEndTime = window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd;
const pageLoadTime = loadEndTime - loadStartTime;
```

- **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**: Splitting the application into smaller chunks and deferring the loading of non-essential resources until needed, reducing initial load time.

## Technology Stack

The Model Browser Web Application is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript Framework**: React
  ```bash
  npm install react
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
  ```bash
  npm install react-router-dom

- **HTTP Client**: Axios
  ```bash
  npm install axios

- **Styling**: Bootstrap
    ```bash
npm install bootstrap





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
